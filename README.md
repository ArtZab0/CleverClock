## 1. Introduction

Waking up in the morning can be quite the challenge at times. Many alarms can either be snoozed or turned off with a click of a button, essentially allowing their users to fall right back asleep without ever fully waking up. The Clever Clock app seeks to provide a solution to this problem by requiring its users to complete a small task/challenge before they are able to silence their alarm. Whether it be a maze, a game of sudoku, an equation to be solved, or a sorting puzzle, each challenge requires a greater deal of brain activation than a snooze/off button. With the greater attention that is required to silence their alarm, we hope that users will be more prepared and more likely to start their day in an efficient manner.

## 2. Running the Software

As a final downloadable version of the app is yet to exist, Android Studio must be used to run the app and see its functionality. Along with Android Studio, Flutter must be downloaded as it was the framework used to build the app. Please use the following links to access guides on how to install Flutter and set it up in Android Studio.

**Download Android Studio:** <https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3sq6BhD2ARIsAJ8MRwXqkuVtIHy3gVa0pKvY33YeHPp79q1CUwHbFh5I4A-tXUxEMHnYh18aAlvREALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>

**Download Flutter:** <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3sq6BhD2ARIsAJ8MRwVa0IP4lfNMA_fV7fjY9ulwL7YdpVCfVNcwBOVle5SVvSueyrpjOXcaAlsrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>

For the Flutter installation, make sure to choose Android as first type of app. Once both have been successfully installed and set up, simply open the folder (Clever-Clock main), created by the downloaded .zip of the project through Github, in Android Studio. Once the project has been opened in Android Studio, the app can be ran by _________________________________________

## 3. Using the Device

### 3.1 Navigating the Login

Upon a successful launch of the app, you will be directed to the login page of the app. You can enter an email and password on this page and then press login to be directed to the main page of the app. Additionally, you can press the "New User? Create Account" button to be taken to a sign up page. On this page you can enter a valid email address and press sign up. After this an email will be sent by the database used for the login to the entered email address. However, clicking this link will only take you back to the login page as accounts are not fully functional at this stage. Nonetheless, return to the main login page and press the purple login button to enter the app.

### 3.2 Setting an Alarm

Once passed the login page and on the home page, press the '+' button in the bottom right corner to add an alarm. This will direct you to the set alarm page where you can set and edit alarms. Press the pencil button to set your first alarm. From here you can either type the time, or use the clock and drag the hands to the desired time before choosing AM or PM and setting the alarm. Once the alarm has been created, you can give it a label before saving it with the button on the bottom of the screen. Once the alarm is saved, you should be sent back the home page and be able to see your alarm.

### 3.3 Queuing Puzzles

From the home page, you can press the gaming controller in the top right of the screen to be taken the puzzle page with all of the puzzles listed out. From here, you can select any puzzle and play it. Use the back button to return to the home page and then click the settings icon in the top right. On the settings page, click the puzzle queue button to manage the queue of puzzles. On the manage puzzle queue page, click any puzzle to add it to the queue for when the alarm is triggered. You can also clear the queue on this page by pressing clear queue. 

### 3.4 Settings

Apart from the manage puzzle queue, there are three other buttons. The enable parent control allows you to set a password to set and delete alarms. Once the password is created, the app will ask you to enter it any time to try to add an alarm, delete an alarm, or disable parent control. The enable snooze button would allow to decide if you want a snooze feature or not for when your alarm goes off. Finally, there is a "Request New Puzzles" button on the bottom of the sending page that will redirect you to a google form that will allow you to describe a puzzle you want in the app. Upon doing so, your response will be sent to the developers.
