## 1. Introduction

Waking up in the morning can be quite the challenge at times. Many alarms can either be snoozed or turned off with a click of a button, essentially allowing their users to fall right back asleep without ever fully waking up. The Clever Clock app seeks to provide a solution to this problem by requiring its users to complete a small task/challenge before they are able to silence their alarm. Whether it be a maze, a game of sudoku, an equation to be solved, or a sorting puzzle, each challenge requires a greater deal of brain activation than a snooze/off button. With the greater attention that is required to silence their alarm, we hope that users will be more prepared and more likely to start their day in an efficient manner.

## 2. Running the Software

As a final downloadable version of the app is yet to exist, Android Studio must be used to run the app and see its functionality. Along with Android Studio, Flutter must be downloaded as it was the framework used to build the app. Please use the following links to access guides on how to install Flutter and set it up in Android Studio.

**Download Android Studio:** <https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3sq6BhD2ARIsAJ8MRwXqkuVtIHy3gVa0pKvY33YeHPp79q1CUwHbFh5I4A-tXUxEMHnYh18aAlvREALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>

**Download Flutter:** <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA3sq6BhD2ARIsAJ8MRwVa0IP4lfNMA_fV7fjY9ulwL7YdpVCfVNcwBOVle5SVvSueyrpjOXcaAlsrEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds>

For the Flutter installation, make sure to choose Android as first type of app. Once both have been successfully installed and set up, simply open the folder (Clever-Clock main) created by the downloaded .zip of the project through Github in Android Studio. Once the project has been opened in Android Studio, the app can be ran
